## URL-Shortner

URL-Shortener service is providing APIs to make url short. It has two endpoints, /encode and /decode.

**-/encode** endpoint will accept a url and return back itâ€™s encoded form
**-/decode**  endpoint will accept encoded-url and return back it's original form


## Technical overview
We are using **Node.js** with **Typescript** to create APIs. To generate API routes we are using the **express.js** framework. For code validation, we are using **eslint**. To make a bug-free app, we should have unit, integration and end-to-end testing. For the test, we are using **jest and supertest**. To generate API docs and test APIs by manual we are using **Swagger**. To manage and store logs effectively we are using **pino**. For schema level validations we are using **joi** . To make the dev process easy we are using **nodemon**. To manage different environments we are using **dotenv**
